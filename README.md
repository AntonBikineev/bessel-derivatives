bessel-derivatives
==================

--------------------------------------------------------
All development is moved to Boost.Math repro
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
General Information
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a partial Boost.Math area for:

* Bessel function derivatives
* This work is being developed for Anton Bikineev's magister thesis research

--------------------------------------------------------
Project details
--------------------------------------------------------

This project adds several new files to the existing file structure
of Boost.Math. These new files contain the implementations of
Bessel function derivatives.

Upon successful completion of this project, the candidate files
in this project may potentially be merged to and/or included
in Boost.Math.

--------------------------------------------------------
Using this project with Boost
--------------------------------------------------------

The files in this project can be used with an existing Boost trunk
or with a distribution of Boost. Do note, however, that at the time
this project is being written, the files require the trunk in order
to compile.

The way to use these files with an existing Boost trunk or distro
is to include the base directory of this project in the "C++ way".
The added include path of this project should be placed *before* the
include path of the Boost trunk or distro.
